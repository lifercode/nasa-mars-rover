# Nasa Mars Rover - Decskill Interview 

### Challenge

With the interest with space exploration increasing, and with our attention focused on Mars,
one of the biggest humanity achievements is the fact of having a robot exploring Mars for us,
more specifically the Curiosity Rover.

Using one of the existing NASA API’s, more specifically the Mars Rover Photos, let’s create a
frontend app, using React that enables a user to see 4 to 6 photosrandomly picked from this API.
No need to worry about repeated photos but pay attention on how they appear to the user.
Make the view responsible enough so that it can be seen either in a desktop or mobile.
Feel free to add any info to the photos, besides the photograph itself, I leave it to your imagination.

### Necessary information

API: [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov) -> got to the search field and type “mars” -> three accordion menus will
appear -> extend the “Mars Rover Photos” all the necessary information will be there. The same
information is present in this document as well

Frontend app -> Create it as you see fit, either using react-create-app or any other module. This
needs to run locally, so if it works in your machine you need to be sure that what you provide will
run in any other machine. How you build it it’s up to you, if you use hooks, if you use class based
components, if you see the need to use Redux or Mobx it’s all up to you.
